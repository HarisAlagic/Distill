### Here is an example. You can find the other visualizations over the "Data analysis" tab.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% ggplot() + aes(wt, mpg) + geom_point() + labs(title = "There is an inverse relationship between weight and miles per gallon: 
The heavier the car the lesser the milage", subtitle = "The relationship between milage and weight", x = "Weight", y = "Miles per Gallon") 
```
